# Customer Churn or Retention Model

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn or retention. The goal is to help businesses identify customers who are likely to leave (churn) and those who are likely to stay (retain), enabling targeted interventions to improve customer loyalty and reduce attrition.

## Overview

Customer churn prediction is an essential task for businesses aiming to sustain growth and profitability. This project leverages statistical and machine learning techniques to build a robust model for forecasting churn risk, using customer data.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Multiple machine learning models for churn prediction
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of results
- Easy-to-understand code and documentation

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/willow788/customer-churn-or-retention-model.git
    cd customer-churn-or-retention-model
    ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your data:** Place your customer data CSV file in the `data/` directory.

2. **Run Jupyter notebooks:** Launch Jupyter and explore the `notebooks/` folder for EDA and modeling workflows.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. **Train models:** Use scripts in the `src/` directory to preprocess data and train models:
    ```bash
    python src/train_model.py
    ```

4. **Generate predictions:** Use the trained model to predict churn risk on new data.

## Data

Sample datasets and data schema are provided in the `data/` folder. Typical features include:

- Customer demographics
- Service usage metrics
- Account information
- Historical churn labels

**Note:** Replace sample data with your own for real-world applications.

## Modeling Approach

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model validation using cross-validation

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix
